# Java Ultimate Maze Obstacle Neutralizer Game (JUMONG)

## Introduction

This repository contains a course project of the Java programming course at Amirkabir University of Tech. in the Spring of 2014 with Prof.Noorhosseini and [Babak Alipour](https://github.com/BabakAp).
This course was my first object-oriented programming course and introduced me to Java 7.
I don't touch the source code and store it here just for historical reasons.
Almost all of the teaching assistants team and the professor migrated from our country.

I want to say thanks to teaching assistants that I remember from that awesome course:

- [Seyed Mohammad Mehdi Ahmadpanah](https://github.com/smahmadpanah)
- Hani Hojjatansari
- [Pantea Habibi](https://github.com/panteaa)
