# Java Ultimate Maze Obstacle Neutralizer Game (JUMONG)

## Introduction

Java programming course at Amirkabir Unviersity of Tech. in the spring of 2014 with Prof.Noorhosseini and [Babak Alipour](https://github.com/BabakAp).
This course was my first object-oriented programming course and this project was my midterm/final projet.
I don't touch the source code and store it here just for historical reasons.
Almost all of the teaching assistents team migrated from our country.

Special Thanks to teaching asistents that I remember:

- [Seyed Mohammad Mehdi Ahmadpanah](https://github.com/smahmadpanah)
- Hani Hojjatansari
- [Pantea Habibi](https://github.com/panteaa)
